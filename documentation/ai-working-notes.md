### Documentation Updates

2. Documented UI color guidelines for future development
3. Added notes about dual-location access for important features
4. Added UI consistency patterns for member management

### Next Steps
1. Continue with message editing and deletion implementation

### Notes
- All UI elements should be tested in both light and dark modes
- Use theme-aware color classes from Tailwind
- Follow destructive action color guidelines for dangerous operations
- Important features should be accessible from multiple logical locations
- Icon-only buttons should have clear hover states and possibly tooltips
- Always test hover states with both light and dark themes
- Use group hover patterns for nested interactive elements
- Maintain consistent styling for similar UI patterns across components
- Use consistent icon and text styles for state indicators
